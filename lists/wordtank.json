              At first these are words gleanded from heard user utterances, or found so-called 
              'related words'. Possibly other texts will be added.
              It is organized  under the words property as an object keyed by POS tags, each of 
              which has an array of word objects; word objects have at least the w and ts (timestamp)
              fields; it may also have a count property and a source property, telling how it got into the system
              typically ts are unix timestamps; postags are those returned by textblob. The array of words under
              each tag should be appended at the end, so newest are last. ",
