Morning-room in a flat in Half-Moon Street.
The room is luxuriously and artistically furnished.
The sound of a piano is heard in the adjoining room.
Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has ceased, enters.
Did you hear what I was playing?
I didnt think it polite to listen, sir.
Im sorry for that, for your sake.
I dont play accurately--any one can play accurately--but I play with wonderful As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.
And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for ?
by the way, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord Shoreman and Mr Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed.
Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
Why is it that at a bachelors establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?
I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.
I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.
Is marriage so demoralising as that?
I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir.
I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present.
That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.
I dont know that I am much interested in your family life.
No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject.
Lanes views on marriage seem somewhat lax.
Really, if the lower orders dont set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?
They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.
What else should bring one anywhere?
Eating as usual, I see,   I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five oclock.
Where have you been since last Thursday?
When one is in town one amuses When one is in the country one amuses other people.
And who are the people you amuse?
Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?
How immensely you must amuse them!
By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?
Why such reckless extravagance in one so young?
Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid wont quite approve of your being here.
My dear fellow, the way you flirt with is perfectly It is almost as bad as the way flirts with you.
I have come up to town expressly to propose to her.
I thought you had come up for pleasure?
How utterly unromantic you are!
I really dont see anything romantic in proposing.
It is very romantic to be in love.
But there is nothing romantic about a definite Why, one may be accepted.
Then the excitement is all over.
The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
If ever I get married, Ill certainly try to forget the fact.
I have no doubt about that, dear .
The Divorce Court was specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.
there is no use speculating on that subject.
Divorces are made in Heaven-- puts out his hand to take a sandwich.
Please dont touch the cucumber sandwiches.
They are ordered specially for .
Well, you have been eating them all the time.
That is quite a different matter.
is devoted to bread and butter.
And very good bread and butter it is too.
Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all.
You behave as if you were married to her already.
You are not married to her already, and I dont think you ever will be.
Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt Girls dont think it right.
It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.
In the second place, I dont give my consent.
My dear fellow, is my first cousin.
And before I allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question.
I dont know any one of that name.
Bring me that laptop that he left in the lab the last time he dined here.
Do you mean to say you have had my laptop all this time?
I wish to goodness you had let me know.
I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.
I was very nearly offering a large reward.
Well, I wish you would offer one.
I happen to be more than usually hard up.
There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.
Enter Lane with the laptop on a salver.
I think that is rather mean of you, I must say.
However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isnt yours after all.
You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private laptop.
it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldnt.
More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldnt read.
I am quite aware of the fact, and I dont propose to discuss modern culture.
It isnt the sort of thing one should talk of.
I simply want my laptop back.
Yes; but this isnt your laptop.
This laptop is a present from some one of the name of , and you said you didnt know any one of that name.
Well, if you want to know, happens to be my aunt.
But why does she call herself little if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells?
From little one with her fondest love.
My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?
Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.
That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt!
For Heavens sake give me back my laptop.
But why does your aunt call you her ?
From little , with her fondest love to her dear .
There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her , I cant quite make out.
Besides, your name isnt at all; it is Ernest.
You have always told me it was Ernest.
I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.
You answer to the name of Ernest.
You look as if your name was Ernest.
You are the most -looking person I ever saw in my life.
It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isnt Its on your cards.
Mr Ernest Worthing, B4, The Albany.
Ill keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to , or to any one else.
Well, my name is Ernest in town and in the country, and the laptop was given to me in the country.
Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt , who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear .
Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.
My dear , you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.
It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isnt a dentist.
It produces a false impression.
Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.
I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret prolixist; and I am quite sure of it now.
What on earth do you mean by a prolixist?
Ill reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and in the country.
Well, produce my laptop first.
Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.
My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all.
In fact its perfectly ordinary.
Old Mr Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cardew.
, who addresses me as her  from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, .
Where is that place in the country, by the way?
That is nothing to you, dear boy.
You are not going to be invited  I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.
I suspected that, my dear fellow!
I have prolixed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions.
Why are you Ernest in town and in the country?
My dear , I dont know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.
When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all Its ones duty to do so.
And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either ones health or ones happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.
That, my dear , is the whole truth pure and simple.
The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!
That wouldnt be at all a bad thing.
Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.
You should leave that to people who havent been at a They do it so well in the daily papers.
What you really are is a prolixist.
I was quite right in saying you were a prolixist.
You are one of the most advanced prolixists I know.
You have invented a very useful younger brother called in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.
I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called prolix, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.
prolix is perfectly invaluable.
If it wasnt for prolixs extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldnt be able to dine with you at Williss to- night, for I have been really engaged to go for more than a week.
I havent asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.
You are absurdly careless about sending out It is very foolish of you.
Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.
You had much better dine with yourself.
I havent the smallest intention of doing anything of the sort.
To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with ones own relations.
In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two.
In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.
She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.
Indeed, it is not even decent  and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.
The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly It looks so bad.
It is simply washing ones clean linen in Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed prolixist I naturally want to talk to you about prolixing.
If accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think Ill kill him in any case.
is a little too much interested in him.
So I am going to get rid of Ernest.
And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr  with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.
Nothing will induce me to part with prolix, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know prolix.
A man who marries without knowing prolix has a very tedious time of it.
If I marry a charming girl like , and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly wont want to know prolix.
You dont seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none.
That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.
Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.
For heavens sake, dont try to be cynical.
Its perfectly easy to be cynical.
My dear fellow, it isnt easy to be anything nowadays.
Theres such a lot of beastly competition about.
The sound of an electric bell is heard.
Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.
Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to , may I dine with you to-night at Williss?
Yes, but you must be serious about it.
I hate people who are not serious about meals.
Good afternoon, dear , I hope you are behaving very well.
Thats not quite the same thing.
In fact the two things rarely go together.
Youre quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.
It would leave no room for developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.
 and  sit down together in the corner.
Im sorry if we are a little late, but I was obliged to call on dear Harbury.
I hadnt been there since her poor husbands death.
I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.
And now Ill have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.
Thanks, mamma, Im quite comfortable where I am.
Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?
There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, I went down twice.
I am greatly distressed, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.
I had some crumpets with Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.
I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.
It certainly has changed its colour.
From what cause I, of course, cannot say.
Ive quite a treat for you to-night, .
I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.
She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.
I am afraid, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.
It would put my table completely out.
Your would have to dine upstairs.
Fortunately he is accustomed to that.
It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend prolix is very ill again.
They seem to think I should be with him.
This Mr prolix seems to suffer from curiously bad health.
Yes; poor prolix is a dreadful invalid.
Well, I must say, that I think it is high time that Mr prolix made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.
This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.
Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.
Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.
Health is the primary duty of life.
I am always telling that to your poor , but he never seems to take much notice as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.
I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr prolix, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.
It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.
Ill speak to prolix, if he is still conscious, and I think I can promise you hell be all right by Saturday.
Of course the music is a great difficulty.
You see, if one plays good music, people dont listen, and if one plays bad music people dont talk.
But Ill run over the programme Ive drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.
Im sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.
French songs I cannot possibly People always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.
But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so.
Charming day it has been, Miss.
Pray dont talk to me about the weather.
Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else.
And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of a temporary absence  I would certainly advise you to do so.
Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.
Ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl I have ever met since I met you.
Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.
And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.
For me you have always had an irresistible fascination.
Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.
We live, as I hope you know in an age of ideals.
The fact is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one.
There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.

Well, really, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names.

And I pity any woman who is married to a man.
She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moments solitude.
You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.
Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.
When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact.
An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.
It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself  And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr Worthing.
While I am making these inquiries, you, will wait for me below in the carriage.

You can take a seat, Mr Worthing.
Thank you, I prefer standing.
I feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.
However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires.
Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.
A man should always have an occupation of some kind.
There are far too many idle men in London as it How old are you?
A very good age to be married at.
I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.
I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance.
Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.
The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.
Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.
If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.
Between seven and eight thousand a year.
What between the duties expected of one during ones lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after ones death, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.
It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up.
Thats all that can be said about land.
I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I dont depend on that for my real income.
In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who make anything out of it.
Well, that point can be cleared up afterwards.
A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature, like , could hardly be expected to reside in the country.
Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Bloxham.
Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months notice.
Oh, she goes about very little.
She is a considerably advanced in years.
Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of What number in Belgrave Square?
However, that could easily be altered.
Do you mean the fashion, or the side?
Well, I am afraid I really have none.
Or come in the evening, at any rate.
To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.
He was evidently a man of some wealth.
Was he born in what the Radical papers call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy?
I am afraid I really dont know.
The fact is, I said I had lost my parents.
It would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem to have lost me I dont actually know who I am by I was well, I was found.
The late Mr Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.
Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you?
Yes, I was in a hand-bag--a somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it--an ordinary hand-bag in fact.
In what locality did this Mr James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this ordinary hand-bag?
In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.
It was given to him in mistake for his own.
The cloak-room at Victoria Station?
Mr Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.
To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.
And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?
As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion--has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now--but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society.
May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?
I need hardly say I would do anything in the world to ensure s happiness.
I would strongly advise you, Mr Worthing, to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.
Well, I dont see how I could possibly manage to do that.
I can produce the hand-bag at any moment.
It is in my dressing-room at home.
I really think that should satisfy you, .
You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter--a girl brought up with the utmost care--to marry into a cloak- room, and form an alliance with a parcel?

I think it is most ill-natured of her.
As far as she is concerned, we are engaged.
Her mother is perfectly unbearable.
Never met such a Gorgon I dont really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite sure that is one.
In any case, she is a monster, without being a myth, which is rather unfair I beg your pardon, I suppose I shouldnt talk about your own aunt in that way before you.
My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.
It is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all.
Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who havent got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.
Well, I wont argue about the matter.
You always want to argue about things.
That is exactly what things were originally made for.
Upon my word, if I thought that, Id shoot myself  You dont think there is any chance of becoming like her mother in about a hundred and fifty years, do you, ?
All women become like their mothers.
and quite as true as any observation in civilised life should be.
I am sick to death of cleverness.
You cant go anywhere without meeting clever people.
The thing has become an absolute public nuisance.
I wish to goodness we had a few fools left.
I should extremely like to meet them.
about the clever people, of course.
By the way, did you tell the truth about your being Ernest in town, and in the country?
My dear fellow, the truth isnt quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.
What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!
The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.
What about the profligate Ernest?
Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.
Ill say he died in Paris of apoplexy.
Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly, dont they?
Yes, but its hereditary, my dear fellow.
Its a sort of thing that runs in families.
You had much better say a severe chill.
You are sure a severe chill isnt hereditary, or anything of that kind?
My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly, in Paris, by a severe chill.
But I thought you said that Miss Cardew was a little too much interested in your poor brother Ernest?
Wont she feel his loss a good deal?
is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say.
She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no attention at all to her lessons.
I will take very good care you never do.
She is excessively pretty, and she is only just eighteen.
Have you told yet that you have an excessively pretty ward who is only just eighteen?
one doesnt blurt these things out to people.
and  are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.
Ill bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.
Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.
Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Williss, we really must go and dress.
Do you know it is nearly seven?
I never knew you when you werent  What shall we do after dinner?
Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?
It is awfully hard work doing nothing.
However, I dont mind hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.
I have something very particular to say to Mr Worthing.
Really, I dont think I can allow this at all.
, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards You are not quite old enough to do that.
From the expression on mammas face I fear we never shall.
Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them.
The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.
Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age of three.
But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife, and I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.
The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with unpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination.

Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moultons duty than yours?
Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you.
Your German grammar is on the table.
We will repeat yesterdays lesson.
It isnt at all a becoming language.
I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after my German lesson.
Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve yourself in every way.
He laid particular stress on your German, as he was leaving for town yesterday.
Indeed, he always lays stress on your German when he is leaving for town.
Sometimes he is so serious that I think he cannot be quite well.
Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so comparatively young as he is.
I know no one who has a higher sense of duty and responsibility.
I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are together.
Mr Worthing has many troubles in his life.
Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his conversation.
You must remember his constant anxiety about that unfortunate young man his brother.
I wish would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother, to come down here sometimes.
We might have a good influence over him, I am sure you certainly would.
You know German, and geology, and things of that kind influence a man very much.
I do not think that even I could produce any effect on a character that according to his own brothers admission is irretrievably weak and vacillating.
Indeed I am not sure that I would desire to reclaim him.
I am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moments notice.
You must put away your diary, .
I really dont see why you should keep a diary at all.
I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my If I didnt write them down, I should probably forget all about them.
Memory, my dear , is the diary that we all carry about with us.
Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and couldnt possibly have happened.
I believe that Memory is responsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.
Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, .
I wrote one myself in earlier days.
How wonderfully clever you are!
I dont like novels that end happily.
The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.
And was your novel ever published?
The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned.
I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid.

Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German lesson, when the Rector came in.
I hope, you are not inattentive.
Were I fortunate enough to be s pupil, I would hang upon her lips.

Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London.

In fact, I believe I am more than usually tall for my age.
You mustnt think that I am wicked.
If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner.
I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.
Of course I have been rather reckless.
In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own small way.
I dont think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must have been very pleasant.
It is much pleasanter being here with you.
I cant understand how you are here at all.
That is a great disappointment.
I am obliged to go up by the first train on Monday morning.
I have a business appointment that I am anxious to miss?
Couldnt you miss it anywhere else?
Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but still I think you had better wait.
I know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating.
He has gone up to buy your outfit.
He has no taste in neckties at all.
I dont think you will require neckties Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to choose between this world and the next world.
The accounts I have received of Australia and the next world, are not particularly encouraging.
This world is good enough for me.
Yes, but are you good enough for it?
That is why I want you to reform me.
You might make that your mission, if you dont mind, cousin .
Im afraid Ive no time, this afternoon.
Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?
You are looking a little worse.
I should have remembered that when one is going to lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesome Wont you come in?
Might I have a buttonhole first?
I never have any appetite unless I have a buttonhole first.
No, Id sooner have a pink rose.
Because you are like a pink rose.
I dont think it can be right for you to talk to me like that.
Then she is a short-sighted old lady.
You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.
She says that all good looks are a snare.
They are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in.
Oh, I dont think I would care to catch a sensible man.
I shouldnt know what to talk to him about.
A misanthrope I can understand--a womanthrope, never!
Believe me, I do not deserve so neologistic a phrase.
The precept as well as the practice of the Primitive Church was distinctly against matrimony.
That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church has not lasted up to the present day.
And you do not seem to realise that by persistently remaining single, a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation.
Men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.
But is a man not equally attractive when married?
No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.
And often, Ive been told, not even to her.
That depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman.
Maturity can always be depended on.
My metaphor was drawn from fruits.
Perhaps she followed us to the schools.
He is dressed in the deepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.
We did not look for you till Monday afternoon.
I have returned sooner than I expected.
Dear Mr Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken some terrible calamity?
More shameful debts and extravagance?
Still leading his life of pleasure?
I offer you my sincere condolence.
You have at least the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and forgiving of brothers.
He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.
He died abroad; in Paris, in fact.
I had a telegram last night from the manager of the Grand Hotel.
Was the cause of death mentioned?
As a man sows, so shall he reap.
I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts.
Will the interment take place here?
He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.
I fear that hardly points to any very serious state of mind at the last.
You would no doubt wish me to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next  My sermon on the meaning of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful, or, as in the present case, distressing.
I have preached it at harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of humiliation and festal days.
The last time I delivered it was in the Cathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the Prevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders.
The Bishop, who was present, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.
that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr.
I suppose you know how to christen all right?
I mean, of course, you are continually christening, arent you?
It is, I regret to say, one of the Rectors most constant duties in this parish.
I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the But they dont seem to know what thrift is.
But is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, Mr Worthing?
Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?
People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.
But it is not for any child, dear Doctor.
the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon, if you have nothing better to do.
But surely, Mr Worthing, you have been christened already?
I dont remember anything about it.
But have you any grave doubts on the subject?
Of course I dont know if the thing would bother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.
The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is a perfectly canonical practice.
You need have no apprehensions.
Sprinkling is all that is necessary, or indeed I think advisable.
At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?
Oh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.
In fact I have two similar ceremonies to perform at that time.
A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the outlying cottages on your own estate.
Poor Jenkins the carter, a most hard-working man.
I dont see much fun in being christened along with other It would be childish.
And now, dear Mr Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.
I would merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.
What seem to us bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.
This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.
Oh, I am pleased to see you back.
But what horrid clothes you have got on!
 goes towards ; he kisses her brow in a melancholy manner.
You look as if you had toothache, and I have got such a surprise for you.
Who do you think is in the dining-room?
He arrived about half an hour ago.
However badly he may have behaved to you in the past he is still your brother.
You couldnt be so heartless as to disown him.
And you will shake hands with him, wont you, ?
After we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return seems to me peculiarly distressing.
My brother is in the dining-room?
I think it is perfectly absurd.
Brother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am very sorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to lead a better life in the future.
 glares at him and does not take his hand.
, you are not going to refuse your own brothers hand?
Nothing will induce me to take his hand.
I think his coming down here disgraceful.
There is some good in every one.
Ernest has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr prolix whom he goes to visit so often.
And surely there must be much good in one who is kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bed of pain.
he has been talking about prolix, has he?
Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr prolix, and his terrible state of health.
Well, I wont have him talk to you about prolix or about anything else.
It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.
Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side.
But I must say that I think that Brother Johns coldness to me is peculiarly I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is the first time I have come here.
, if you dont shake hands with Ernest I will never forgive you.
Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it.
Its pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation?
I think we might leave the two brothers together.
Certainly, My little task of reconciliation is over.
You have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.
We must not be premature in our judgments.
You young scoundrel, you must get out of this place as soon as possible.
I dont allow any prolixing here.
I have put my things in the room next to yours, sir.
I have unpacked it and put it in the room next to your own.
I am afraid I cant stay more than a week this time.
Your duty as a gentleman calls you back.
My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree.
You are not to talk of her like that.
Well, I dont like your clothes.
You look perfectly ridiculous in them.
Why on earth dont you go up and change?
It is perfectly childish to be in deep mourning for a man who is actually staying for a whole week with you in your house as a guest.
You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or anything else.
You have got to leave by the four-five train.
I certainly wont leave you so long as you are in mourning.
If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I suppose.
I should think it very unkind if you didnt.
Well, will you go if I change my clothes?
I never saw anybody take so long to dress, and with such little result.
Well, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed as you are.
If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely over-educated.
Your vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your presence in my garden utterly absurd.
However, you have got to catch the four-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.
This prolixing, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.
I think it has been a great success.
She picks up the can and begins to water the flowers.
But I must see her before I go, and make arrangements for another prolix.
Oh, I merely came back to water the roses.
He has gone to order the dog-cart for me.
Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?
It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time.
The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity.
But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.
I hope I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection.
I think your frankness does you great credit.
If you will allow me, I will copy your remarks into my diary.
Id give anything to look at it.
You see, it is simply a very young girls record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently meant for publication.
When it appears in volume form I hope you will order a copy.
I delight in taking down from dictation.
I have reached absolute perfection.
When one is dictating one should speak fluently and not cough.
Besides, I dont know how to spell a cough.
Ever since I first looked upon your wonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.
I dont think that you should tell me that you love me wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.
Hopelessly doesnt seem to make much sense, does it?
would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on till next week, at the same hour.
I dont care for anybody in the whole world but you.
Why, we have been engaged for the last three months.
Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.
Well, ever since dear first confessed to us that he had a younger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed the chief topic of conversation between myself and And of course a man who is much talked about is always very attractive.
One feels there must be something in him, after all.
I daresay it was foolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.
And when was the engagement actually settled?
Worn out by your entire ignorance of my existence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and after a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old tree The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this is the little bangle with the true lovers knot I promised you always to wear.
Yes, youve wonderfully good taste, Ernest.
Its the excuse Ive always given for your leading such a bad life.
And this is the box in which I keep all your dear letters.
Kneels at table, opens box, and produces letters tied up with blue ribbon.
But, my own sweet , I have never written you any letters.
You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest.
I remember only too well that I was forced to write your letters for you.
I wrote always three times a week, and sometimes oftener.
They would make you far too conceited.
The three you wrote me after I had broken off the engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can hardly read them without crying a little.
But was our engagement ever broken off?
You can see the entry if you like.
To-day I broke off my engagement with I feel it is better to do so.
The weather still continues charming.
But why on earth did you break it off?
, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it off.
Particularly when the weather was so charming.
It would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadnt been broken off at least once.
But I forgave you before the week was out.
What a perfect angel you are, .
He kisses her, she puts her fingers through his hair.
I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?
Yes, darling, with a little help from others.
Youll never break off our engagement again, ?
I dont think I could break it off now that I have actually met Besides, of course, there is the question of your name.
You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.
There is something in that name that seems to inspire absolute confidence.
I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest.
But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had some other name?
Oh, any name you like----for instance  But I dont like the name of .
Well, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really cant see why you should object to the name of .
In fact, it is rather an aristocratic name.
Half of the chaps who get into the Bankruptcy Court are called .
But seriously, if my name was , couldnt you love me?
I might respect you, I might admire your character, but I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided attention.
Your Rector here is, I suppose, thoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials of the Church?
Chasuble is a most learned man.
He has never written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.
I must see him at once on a most important christening--I mean on most important business.
I shant be away more than half an hour.
Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that I only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard that you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour.
Couldnt you make it twenty minutes?
I must enter his proposal in my diary.
A Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr Worthing.
On very important business, Miss Fairfax states.
Isnt Mr Worthing in his library?
Mr Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some time ago.
Pray ask the to come out here; Mr Worthing is sure to be back soon.
I suppose one of the many good elderly women who are associated with in some of his philanthropic work in I dont quite like women who are interested in philanthropic I think it is so forward of them.
Pray let me introduce myself to you.
Something tells me that we are going to be great I like you already more than I can say.
My first impressions of people are never wrong.
How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such a comparatively short time.
And you will always call me , wont you?
Then that is all quite settled, is it not?
Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who I am.
You have never heard of papa, I suppose?
Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown.
I think that is quite as it should be.
The home seems to me to be the proper sphere for the man.
And certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not?
It makes men so very attractive.
, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?
I am very fond of being looked at.
You are here on a short visit, I suppose.
Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years, resides here also?
I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.
My dear guardian, with the assistance of , has the arduous task of looking after me.
It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a How secretive of him!
He grows more interesting hourly.
I am not sure, however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed  I am very fond of you, ; I have liked you ever since I met you!
But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr Worthings ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were--well, just a little older than you seem to be--and not quite so very alluring in appearance.
In fact, if I may speak candidly-- Pray do!
I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite candid.
Well, to speak with perfect candour, I wish that you were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.
Ernest has a strong upright nature.
He is the very soul of truth and honour.
Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception.
But even men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of others.
Modern, no less than Ancient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to.
If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.
I beg your pardon, did you say Ernest?
Oh, but it is not Mr Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.
It is his brother--his elder brother.
Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a brother.
I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.
And now that I think of it I have never heard any man mention his brother.
The subject seems distasteful to most men.
, you have lifted a load from my mind.
It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours, would it not?
Of course you are quite, quite sure that it is not Mr Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?
Dearest , there is no reason why I should make a secret of it to you.
Our little county newspaper is sure to chronicle the fact next week.
Mr Ernest Worthing and I are engaged to be married.
My darling , I think there must be some slight error.
Mr Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.
The announcement will appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.
I am afraid you must be under some Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago.
It is certainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.
If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so.
I never travel without my diary.
One should always have something sensational to read in the train.
I am so sorry, dear , if it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior claim.
It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear , if it caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.
If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a firm hand.
Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are married.
Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?
On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak ones mind.
Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an engagement?
This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners.
When I see a spade I call it a spade.
I am glad to say that I have never seen a It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.
Enter Merriman, followed by the footman.
He carries a salver, table cloth, and plate stand.
The presence of the servants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls chafe.
Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?
Merriman begins to clear table and lay cloth.
Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?
From the top of one of the hills quite close one can see five counties.
I dont think I should like that; I hate crowds.
I suppose that is why you live in town?
 bites her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.
Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.
So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.
I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.
Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.
Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the country, if anybody who is anybody does.
The country always bores me to death.
This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it not?
I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at present.
It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?
Sugar is not fashionable any more.
 looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into the cup.
Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.
Merriman does so, and goes out with footman.
drinks the tea and makes a grimace.
Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the bread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake.
You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.
I am known for the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.
To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.
From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.
I felt that you were false and deceitful.
I am never deceived in such matters.
My first impressions of people are invariably right.
It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable time.
No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make in the neighbourhood.
May I ask if you are engaged to be married to this young lady?
What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?
I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax.
The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my guardian, Mr John Worthing.
May I ask you--are you engaged to be married to this young lady?
What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?
I felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew.
The gentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin, Mr Moncrieff.
The two girls move towards each other and put their arms round each others waists as if for protection.
I could deny anything if I liked.
A gross deception has been practised on both of us.
You will call me sister, will you not?
There is just one question I would like to be allowed to ask my guardian.
Mr Worthing, there is just one question I would like to be permitted to put to you.
We are both engaged to be married to your brother so it is a matter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at present.
----it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth.
It is the first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.
However, I will tell you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest.
I have no brother at I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the future.
Had you never a brother of any kind?
I am afraid it is quite clear, that neither of us is engaged to be married to any one.
It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find herself in.
They will hardly venture to come after us there.
No, men are so cowardly, arent they?
This ghastly state of things is what you call prolixing, I suppose?
Yes, and a perfectly wonderful prolix it is.
The most wonderful prolix I have ever had in my life.
Well, youve no right whatsoever to prolix here.
One has a right to prolix anywhere one Every serious prolixist knows that.
Well, one must be serious about something, if one wants to have any amusement in life.
I happen to be serious about prolixing.
What on earth you are serious about I havent got the remotest idea.
About everything, I should fancy.
You have such an absolutely trivial nature.
Well, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this wretched business is that your friend prolix is quite exploded.
You wont be able to run down to the country quite so often as you used to do, dear .
Your brother is a little off colour, isnt he, dear ?
You wont be able to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom was.
As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your taking in a sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable.
To say nothing of the fact that she is my ward.
I can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant, clever, thoroughly experienced young like Miss Fairfax.
To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin.
I wanted to be engaged to , that is all.
Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to .
There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.
I dont think there is much likelihood, of you and Miss Fairfax being united.
Well, that is no business of yours.
If it was my business, I wouldnt talk about it.
It is very vulgar to talk about ones business.
Only people like stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.
How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I cant make out.
You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.
Well, I cant eat muffins in an agitated manner.
The butter would probably get on my cuffs.
One should always eat muffins quite It is the only way to eat them.
I say its perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the circumstances.
When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink.
At the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy.
Besides, I am particularly fond of muffins.
Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that greedy way.
I wish you would have tea-cake instead.
I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own garden.
But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.
I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances.
That is a very different thing.
He seizes the muffin-dish from .
, I wish to goodness you would go.
You cant possibly ask me to go without having some dinner.
No one ever does, except vegetarians and people like that.
Besides I have just made arrangements with Dr.
Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name of Ernest.
My dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better.
I made arrangements this morning with Dr.
Chasuble to be christened myself at 5.
30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest.
We cant both be christened Ernest.
Besides, I have a perfect right to be christened if I like.
There is no evidence at all that I have ever been christened by anybody.
I should think it extremely probable I never was, and so does Dr.
It is entirely different in your case.
You have been christened already.
Yes, but I have not been christened for years.
Yes, but you have been christened.
So I know my constitution can stand it.
If you are not quite sure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it rather dangerous your venturing on it now.
It might make you very You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely connected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a severe chill.
Yes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.
It usent to be, I know--but I daresay it is now.
Science is always making wonderful improvements in things.
Oh, that is nonsense; you are always talking nonsense.
, you are at the muffins again!
I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.
Why on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for your guests?
What ideas you have of hospitality!
I havent quite finished my tea yet!
and there is still one muffin left.
 groans, and sinks into a chair.
ACT DROP THIRD ACT SCENE Morning-room at the Manor House.
The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of shame left.
They dont seem to notice us at all.
Let us preserve a dignified silence.
They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.
This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.
But we will not be the first to speak.
Mr Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.
, your common sense is invaluable.
Mr Moncrieff, kindly answer me the following question.
Why did you pretend to be my guardians brother?
In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.
That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?
Yes, dear, if you can believe him.
But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.
In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.
Mr Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a brother?
Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?
Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?
I have the gravest doubts upon the subject.
This is not the moment for German scepticism.
Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr Worthings.
That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.
I am more than content with what Mr Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
There are principles at stake that one cannot surrender.
The task is not a pleasant one.
Could we not both speak at the same time?
I nearly always speak at the same time as other people.
Will you take the time from me?
and Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier.
But we are going to be christened this afternoon.
For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?
To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?
How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!
Where questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.
They have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely nothing.
Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr Worthing, mamma.
Hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.
Apprised, sir, of my daughters sudden flight by her trusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin, I followed her at once by a luggage train.
Her unhappy father is, I am glad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than usually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on the Influence of a permanent income on Thought.
I do not propose to undeceive him.
Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.
But of course, you will clearly understand that all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately from this moment.
On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.
I am engaged to be married to , !
You are nothing of the kind, sir.
May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr prolix resides?
prolix is somewhere else at present.
His death must have been extremely sudden.
I killed prolix this afternoon.
I mean poor prolix died this afternoon.
Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?
I was not aware that Mr prolix was interested in social legislation.
If so, he is well punished for his morbidity.
My dear , I mean he was found out!
The doctors found out that prolix could not live, that is what I mean--so prolix died.
He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.
I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.
And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr prolix, may I ask, Mr Worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?
I am engaged to be married to , .
Mr Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, .
I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this particular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance.
I think some preliminary inquiry on my part would not be out of place.
Mr Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected with any of the larger railway stations in London?
Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or persons whose origin was a Terminus.
 looks perfectly furious, but restrains himself.
Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late Mr Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.
; Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.
That sounds not unsatisfactory.
Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen.
But what proof have I of their authenticity?
I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.
They are open to your inspection, .
I have known strange errors in that publication.
Miss Cardews family solicitors are Messrs.
A firm of the very highest position in their profession.
Indeed I am told that one of the Mr Markbys is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.
I have also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of Miss Cardews birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.
A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl.
I am not myself in favour of premature experiences.
the time approaches for our departure.
As a matter of form, Mr Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?
about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.
Goodbye, So pleased to have seen you.
A hundred and thirty thousand pounds!
Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.
Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve with time.
We live, I regret to say, in an age of Pretty child!
your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it.
But we can soon alter all that.
A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of time.
I remember recommending one to young Lancing, and after three months her own husband did not know her.
And after six months nobody knew her.
Then bends, with a practised smile, to .
Kindly turn round, sweet child.
No, the side view is what I want.
There are distinct social possibilities in your profile.
The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile.
The chin a little higher, Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.
They are worn very high, just at present.
There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardews profile.
is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole And I dont care twopence about social possibilities.
Never speak disrespectfully of Society, .
Only people who cant get into it do that.
Dear child, of course you know that has nothing but his debts to depend upon.
But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.
When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune of any kind.
But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand in my way.
Well, I suppose I must give my consent.
You may also address me as for the future.
The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.
To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long They give people the opportunity of finding out each others character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.
I beg your pardon for interrupting you, but this engagement is quite out of the question.
I am Miss Cardews guardian, and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.
That consent I absolutely decline to give.
is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.
He has nothing, but he looks everything.
It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his moral character.
I suspect him of being untruthful.
 and look at him in indignant amazement.
I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.
This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.
Under an assumed name he drank, Ive just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, 89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.
Continuing his disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.
He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.
And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I dont intend to have a brother, not even of any kind.
I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.
Mr Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely to overlook my nephews conduct to you.
That is very generous of you, My own decision, however, is unalterable.
Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go to evening parties.
You are perfectly right in making some slight Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her It looks so calculating Eighteen, but admitting to twenty at evening parties.
Well, it will not be very long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.
So I dont think your guardians consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.
Pray excuse me, for interrupting you again, but it is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfathers will Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.
That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.
Thirty- five is a very attractive age.
London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty- five for years.
Dumbleton is an instance in point.
To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which was many years ago now.
I see no reason why our dear  should not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at present.
There will be a large accumulation of property.
, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?
Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldnt wait all that time.
I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.
It always makes me rather I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.
My dear Mr Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five--a remark which I am bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature--I would beg of you to reconsider your decision.
But my dear , the matter is entirely in your own The moment you consent to my marriage with , I will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.
You must be quite aware that what you propose is out of the question.
Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.
That is not the destiny I propose for .
, of course, can choose for himself.
Come, dear, we have already missed five, if not six, To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.
Everything is quite ready for the christenings.
Is not that somewhat premature?
Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.
The idea is grotesque and irreligious!
I will not hear of such excesses.
Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which you wasted your time and money.
Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon?
I dont think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical value to either of us, Dr.
I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr Worthing.
They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.
However, as your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the church at once.
Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for the last hour and a half has been waiting for me in the vestry.
Did I hear you mention a misprision?
Yes, I am on my way to join her.
Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.
This matter may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.
Is this a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?
She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the very picture of respectability.
It is obviously the same person.
May I ask what position she holds in your household?
, has been for the last three years Miss Cardews esteemed governess and valued companion.
In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.
I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.
I have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.
Catches sight of , who has fixed her with a stony glare.
misprision grows pale and quails.
She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.
 approaches in a humble manner.
The Canon starts back in horror.
and pretend to be anxious to shield and from hearing the details of a terrible public scandal.
Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknells house, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex.
A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater.
It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.
misprision starts in involuntary indignation.
, I admit with shame that I do not know.
The plain facts of the case are these.
On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.
I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few unoccupied hours.
In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in the hand-bag.
But where did you deposit the hand-bag?
, this is a matter of no small importance to me.
I insist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.
I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in London.
I must retire to my room for a moment.
If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my What do you think this means, ?
I need hardly tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to occur.
They are hardly considered the thing.
Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.
Your guardian has a very emotional nature.
This noise is extremely unpleasant.
It sounds as if he was having an argument.
I dislike arguments of any kind.
They are always vulgar, and often convincing.
I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.
Enter  with a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.
Examine it carefully before you speak.
The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer.
Yes, here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days.
Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.
And here, on the lock, are my initials.
I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there.
The bag is undoubtedly I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.
It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.
, more is restored to you than this hand-bag.
I was the baby you placed in it.
I do not deny that is a serious blow.
But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?
Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly?
Why should there be one law for men, and another for women?
Mr Worthing, there is some error.
There is the who can tell you who you really are.
, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I am?
I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please you.
You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs.
Moncrieff, and consequently s elder brother.
Then I have a brother after all.
,--how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother?
Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.
, you young scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future.
You have never behaved to me like a brother in all your life.
Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.
I did my best, however, though I was out of practice.
What is your Christian name, now that you have become some one else?
I had quite forgotten that point.
Your decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?
I never change, except in my affections.
What a noble nature you have, !
Then the question had better be cleared up at once.
At the time when left me in the hand-bag, had I been christened already?
Every luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.
Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.
Yes, but what was my fathers Christian name?
I cannot at the present moment recall what the Generals Christian name was.
But I have no doubt he had one.
And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of that kind.
Cant you recollect what our fathers Christian name was?
My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.
He died before I was a year old.
His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, ?
The General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.
But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military directory.
The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.
These delightful records should have been my constant study.
Rushes to bookcase and tears the books out.
Generals Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what ghastly names they have--Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!
Lieutenant 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian names, Ernest John.
Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite calmly.
I always told you, my name was mud, didnt I?
Yes, I remember now that the General was called out.
I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.
I felt from the first that you could have no other name!
It is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.
For I feel that you are sure to change.
You seem to be displaying signs of triviality.
On the contrary, Ive now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being.
